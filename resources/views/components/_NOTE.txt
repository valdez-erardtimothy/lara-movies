"COMPONENTS" folder isn't meant to contain blade view components.
This folder contains small blade subviews that aren't meant to stand alone.
views at "pages" folder are standalone pages that @include from components folder

I haven't saw the blade components yet as of naming this folder
please do not confuse.


what does it do exactly? 
this folder contains blade subviews that can be reused on other pages.
small single-use parts are not needed to be a separate subview,
but those that tend to be reused are to have a separate file to follow DRY principle
e.g. the forms that are used for Create and Update, navbar.
